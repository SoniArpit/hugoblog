# Hello <span class="hello"></span>

I'm an introverted software developer who just want to make every day a little bit better than the day before (1% change every day). (Focus on the word "want to").

I build things, break things (sometimes servers too), and, of course, fix things.

Here I'll share what I've learned, what I'm learning, and what I'm building. I hope you'll find something useful here.

Don't meet me in person; I'm weird. (×﹏×)

Ahhh, I forgot to tell you my name. I'm Arpit Soni. Nice to meet you. ٩(◕‿◕)۶

Now read my posts (☞⌐■_■)☞ [blog](/blog)
